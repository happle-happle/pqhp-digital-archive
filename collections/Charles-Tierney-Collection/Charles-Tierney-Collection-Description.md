### Collection Description
The collection contains photographs, publications, and ephemera produced broadly for the LGBT population of Pittsburgh from the 1980s to the 1990s with an emphasis on documentation of social events tied to gay owned and operated bars. These materials were collected by Chuck Tierney as a bar patron, employee, and owner.

Charles “Chuck” P. Tierney (b. March 29, 1948 – d. October 11, 2017) was a gay business owner and community organizer in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania. With his partner Chuck Honse, he owned and operated the Holiday Bar in Oakland for over 40 years, along with New York, New York (now 5801 in Shadyside) Images Bar (Downtown), The Fourth Avenue Stock Exchange (Formerly Zak’s 4th Avenue Downtown), and Gilbert’s Restaurant (now the Bloomfield Bridge Tavern in Bloomfield). His role as a business owner extended to the co-founding of the Pittsburgh Tavern Guild, the Golden Triangle Picnic Association, and The Delta Foundation of which he was an emeritus board member until his death. His reputation as a prominent business owner and community figure helped him organize philanthropic efforts including the City Theater AIDS Benefit for the Shepherd Wellness Community, and the 1989 Memory Project quilt display at the Convention Center in Downtown Pittsburgh.
