### Collection Description
Marsha Monster Mellow Collection contains tapes and documents from the Pittsburgh nightlife scene with emphasis on drag shows at Pegasus Lounge located at 818 Liberty Avenue in Downtown Pittsburgh. 

Marsha (aka Mark Wilkes) had come of age in the Pittsburgh gay nightclub, becoming a fixture in bar productions as well as regional pageants. Her own tape collection covers stage productions, benefit shows, and bar shows that help illustrate the DIY queer and gay drag cabaret scene in the city, entangled with local on-the-ground activism from AIDS awareness and public health efforts to youth programs like Growing Alterative Youth who were key in creating a space for minors in an otherwise adult-exclusive entertainment scene. She likewise appears in tapes from several other collections, both as a competitor and audience member. Marsha describes herself as a bridge between the 1980s and 2000s generations of drag performers in Pittsburgh, highlighting that the productions themselves are products of a vital social commitment to creating work collaboratively. There have been signficant changes to the cabaret landscape and renewed national interest in drag performance as a main-stream celebrity career path. Marsha's collection is a key reminder that the pathos of drag comes from long-term relationships of collaborative creative practice.

Marsha's collection was lent for digitization in the summer of 2024. Many of the tapes have typical artifacts of mold damager and tape stretch, producing watchable but often interrupted digital captures.
