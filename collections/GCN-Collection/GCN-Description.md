## Gay Cable Network Collection

[![cryout! right to privacy conference speaker](/collections/GCN-Collection/image-files/cryoutthumb.png)](./GCN-Description.md)

### Collection Description
This collection contains digitized video contributed by Pam Lewis, producer of the Gay Cable Network program (late 1980s) for Pittsburgh Cable Television (PCTV21). The Gay Cable Network was a local program featuring original content covering gay and lesbian artists, political actions, and social events. The seven tapes in this collection include fashion shows, organization interviews, direct-actions, protests, press conferences, and performance art across Pittsburgh.
The donated footage includes both edited and in-progress works, often with varying events recorded on one tape or across multiple tapes. The Gay Cable Network was made possible by a grant from Lambda Foundation of Pittsburgh, a nonprofit 501c3 Gay and Lesbian charity funded by a seed investment from the Pittsburgh Tavern Guild.
