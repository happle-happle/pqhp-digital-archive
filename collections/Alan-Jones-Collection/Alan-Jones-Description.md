### Collection Description

**Some items in this collection contain representations of nudity. Please use your best judgement continuing to browse**
Alan Jones worked in Pittsburgh public health specializing as a case worker at the Pittsburgh AIDS Task Force (now Allies Health + Wellness) since the beginning of the 1990s. In addition to over 30 years caring for clients of PATF, he is a frequently requested speaker about surviving the epidemic and the culture wars over sexual identity. When Harrison Apple began their research on Robert "Lucky" Johns, Alan was their first interview subject. Alan's life story and career interweaves a love of history and a passionate advocacy for the breadth of experience that makes up his close circle and broader community. Alan endears himself to many and as a result, he often received and collected safer-sex kits and condoms from around the world. These items, though less central to AIDS prevention/care messaging than prior to the emergence of pill and injection based PreP, are a rich archive of communication technology and design towards sexual health in a turbulent historical moment that was simultaneously a matter of life and death. He donated this collection to the PQHP in 2025, where Harrison processed them into 4 series, organized by item type.
