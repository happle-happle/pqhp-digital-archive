## Collection Title: Fefe Damiana D'Opulence Collection
### Collection Description
The Dame Fefe Damiana D'Opulence collection contains digital copies of photographs and VHS tapes, collected by Fefe, that document her career as a drag performer in West Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Washington D.C. As mother of the House of Opulence, Fefe's collection also offers a glimpse into the growth of the drag house during the 1990s through pageants, benefits, and weekly shows at a network of bars and clubs that regularly hosted drag performers across the mid-atlantic and mid-west regions of the US. The still photographs were scanned by Fefe D'Opulence and tape digitization was done by Harrison Apple of the PQHP.
