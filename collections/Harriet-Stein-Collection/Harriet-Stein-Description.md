## Harriet Stein Collection

[![harriet and friends"](/collections/Harriet-Stein-Collection/image-files/Series-2/Scan115thumb.png)](./Harriet-Stein-Description.md)

### Collection Description
This collection contains personal items illustrating parts of her life in the punk, lesbian, and radical political scene in Pittsburgh from the 1970s to the present. Items include physical ephemera documenting the voter outreach conducted by Harriet as a member of the Gertrude Stein Political Club of Greater Pittsburgh, as well as her punk poster/newsletter collection pulled from Pittsburgh telephone polls.

### Series *(Items within the collection organized by topic or media)*
- [**Series 1: Gertrude Stein Political Club**](#series-1-Gertrude-Stein-Political-Club) - Election voter guides and hand noted results of elections by Harriet Stein. [The Gertrude Stein Political Club](http://www.gertrudesteinclub.org) was a multi-partisan organization based in Pittsburgh, PA, working in electoral politics in support of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender issues and women's rights by helping candidates who are committed to helping us secure those rights. GSPCGP provides information about candidates' positions on issues important to the gay, lesbian, bisexual and transexual voter; we endorse candidates based on their past record and on their responses to our candidate questionnaires.
- [**Series 2: Personal Ephemera and Photographs**](#series-2-Personal-Ephemera-and-Photographs) - Personal items including photographs from trips with friends and a postcard advertising an art show at Bloomer's Bar, formerly Wild Sisters Collective, a key lesbian feminist space at the corner of Jane and 27th street in Pittsburgh's Southside. See Patricia Ulbrich's research [InSisterhood](http://www.insisterhood.info/historical-library/multimedia-exhibits/) for more information about Wild Sisters, Bloomers, the women behind them and their broader political and cultural landscape.
- [**Series 3: Punk Show Posters**](#series-3-Punk-Show-Posters) - Posters from Punk Shows primarily in the early 1980s, collected by Harriet. These posters were digtized by Harrison Apple following oral history interviews with Harret. These scans along with other PQHP video content have been used for the REPUNK reunion of Pittsburgh Punk bands throughout the 2010s. The original posters are now held at the Heinz History Center Dietre Archives.
