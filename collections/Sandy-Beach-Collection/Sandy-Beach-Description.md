### Collection Description
Sandy Beach is an interior designer from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, who was also active as a model and drag performer through the 1980s and 1990s including the title of runner up for Miss Pittsburgh 1988. Known for her mid century fashion and makeup, she was frequently hired to perform as a model for the growing vintage market in Pittsburgh, inlcuding advertising for the Ellsworth Avenue boutiques "Eons" and "Hey Betty!"

She shared her materials with the Pittsburgh Queer History Project after an interview with Harrison Apple about her career in and out of drag, as well her relationship to 1980s and 90s video artists and photographers who created programs through PCTV 21, Pittsburgh's local cable access channel.
